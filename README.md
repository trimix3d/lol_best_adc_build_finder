# LoL best ADC build finder
A command line program that can automatically find the best items combinations for an ADC in LoL.

The release versions number follows the patch number of League of Legends.

# How to run

## Download the lastest release
Go to the lastest [release](https://github.com/trimix3d/lol_best_adc_build_finder/releases) and download the executable (only if you are on windows with x86_64 CPU), then run it.

## Compile from source
If your OS/CPU architecture is not included in the release or if you want to compile the program yourself:
1. You need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.
2. Download and extract the source code in [releases](https://github.com/trimix3d/lol_best_adc_build_finder/releases)/git pull the repository.
3. Go in the directory containing the source code (on the same level as the `src` folder and `cargo.toml` file) and build the executable with the command:
> cargo build --release
